Synopsis

Convolutional neural network for image recognition. Its goal is to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects.

Code example

You will find 4 programs. The main one is "dlnd_image_classification.ipynb". The aim of "dlnd_image_classification.html" is to help to visualize the code, right in your browser. On the other hand, "helper.py" and "problem_unittests.py" are auxiliar programs needed to run the image classificator. We assume that all the scripts have to be in the same directory, otherwise, you will have to indicate the path.

Motivation

This project is part of the wonderful Deep Learning Foundations Nanodegree, of Udacity. You just can download it and running, but in that case
you would not learn more. It is and educational tool, and the more of you would be in it more useful will became.

Installation

I order tu run you will need python 3.5 in your computer, with the Google Tensorflow library for Machine Learning installed. Probably, in python 2.7
this programs will not work, since they have not implementened and test in this version. If you have a GPU Cudda Compatible, you can just run 
locally the program. If not this kind of Neural Networls are extremely low, when running, on CPU. I strongly recommend use a Cloud Computing 
service, as AWS.

Tests

Just run the code "dlnd_image_classification.ipynb" in a Anaconda Jupyter Notebook, with all the dependencies installed. This is a first version and
the results are everything but spectacular, with accuracy of 66% in test predictions. Much better programmers than me are well above 70-80% in 
accuracy.

Contributors

This little proect would have be impossible without the advices and support of a lot classmate. I would like to thank specially to koby2000 and 
brotherhelmer. Without your patience and support and would not have been able to do it. Thanks guys!
